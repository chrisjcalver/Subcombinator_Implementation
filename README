This is an abstract machine for demonstration purposes of the subcombinator implementation of the lambda calclulus.

To run this code Python 3 must be installed with the following libraries installed:

pygraphviz
matplotlib
copy

Pygraphviz can be difficult to install. See the below link for full instructions.

 https://pygraphviz.github.io/documentation/pygraphviz-1.3.1/install.html

Note that graphviz must first be installed, directly to the system and outside of the Python environment.

The following commands should install all dependencies on an Ubuntu operating system:

sudo apt install python3-pip

sudo apt-get install python3-dev graphviz libgraphviz-dev pkg-config

pip install pygraphviz

pip install matplotlib

Note that if unable to install the pygraphviz package the import can be deleted and as long as the runsteps function is always called with False as an input the library will not be used.
